= Starter Project For C++ Game Development with SDL2
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 3

== Project Setup
The only dependency you will need to build and run this project is SDL2
library. I'm using a Macbook, so if you are using something else you will 
need to find the information for your particular development environment.

For mac users, you can just simply install SDL2 using brew:
```
brew install sdl2
```

== Building The Example Starter Project

```
git clone git@github.com:ch88251/sdl-cpp-starter-project.git
cd sdl-cpp-starter-project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
